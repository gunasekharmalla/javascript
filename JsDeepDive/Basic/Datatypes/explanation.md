JavaScript has two main categories of data types: Primitive and Non-Primitive (Reference) types.

1. Primitive Data Types (Stored directly in memory)
     These are immutable and stored by value.

 => Number → Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

 => BigInt → Used for very large integers beyond Number limits.

 => String → Represents textual data.

 => Boolean → Can be either true or false.

 => Undefined → A variable declared but not assigned a value.

 => Null → Represents an intentional absence of any value.

 => Symbol → Unique and immutable identifiers (used for object properties).

2.  Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Stored by reference)
      These are mutable and stored in memory by reference.
 => Object → A collection of key-value pairs.

 => Array → A special type of object for storing lists.

 => Function → A callable object.

 => Date → Represents dates and times.

 => RegExp → Regular expressions for pattern matching.
